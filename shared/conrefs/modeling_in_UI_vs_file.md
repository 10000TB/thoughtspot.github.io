# Modeling in the Web interface vs. in the modeling file

You can change these settings in two ways, both of which have the same effect:

1.  [Model data in the Web interface.](../../admin_guide/data_modeling/model_data_in_UI.html)
2.  [Model data in bulk in the model file.](../../admin_guide/data_modeling/edit_model_file.html#)

Choose the model file method if you want to make many changes in one bulk operation.
