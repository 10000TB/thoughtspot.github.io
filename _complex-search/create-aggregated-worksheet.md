This procedure walks you through creating a view from a search. To create a view from a search:

1. Start a new search, or edit an existing visualization from a pinboard.

    Any filters or aggregations created during this search will be reflected in the view.

2. If you want to use a different aggregation than the default one for any column, set it from the column header.

     ![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/aggregation_change.png "Select an aggregation")

3. Save the answer as a **View**.

     ![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/save_as_worksheet.png "Save as a View")
