# Advanced searches topics

Most searches in ThoughtSpot are easy to do without training. But there are some advanced search features that are very powerful, which may require some guidance. This section explains how to use the more advanced features.

Here are some of the more advanced features:

-   [Keyword searches](about_keyword_searches.html) allow you to augment your search with predefined keywords. These keywords range from date, time, number, and filter words.
-   [Worksheets created from searches](about_query_on_query.html#) allow you to save a search as a worksheet, optionally link it to other data sources, and do another search on top of it. This workflow allows you to produce some complex reports, like those that would require nested SQL queries in some other tools.
-   [Formulas in searches](add_formula_to_search.html#) brings the power of formulas to regular searches, instead of requiring that you first create a worksheet. This allows any user to do mathematical operations, use if...then...else logic, check for empty (null) values, bucket their data, etc.
-   [Pivot tables](about_pivoting_a_table.html) derived their name from their ability to rotate, or pivot, their own graphical structure. You can drag and drop fields to change the display to get different summaries or create cross tabulations.

-   **[About keyword searches](../../complex-search/about_keyword_searches.html)**  
Use keywords when asking a question to narrow and further define your search.
-   **[About worksheets from searches](../../complex-search/about_query_on_query.html)**  
If you want to do an advanced search that involves what is essentially a search on top of another search, try saving your search as a worksheet. Then you can use the saved worksheet as a data source for a new search.
-   **[About formulas in searches](../../complex-search/add_formula_to_search.html)**  
To provide richer insights, you can add a formula to your search. The Formula Builder includes many types of operators, such as logical (if, then, else), math, date, and text string functions.
-   **[About pivot tables](../../complex-search/about_pivoting_a_table.html)**  
Pivot tables in ThoughtSpot use the well known drag-and-drop interface. Creating a pivot table enables exploring alternate visualization of data in a wide table. The basic idea is that some data is easier to consume when laid out horizontally, while others, vertically.
