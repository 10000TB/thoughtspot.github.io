There are several aspects of security, including access and permissions, data security and privacy, and security from an IT perspective.

- [System Security](audit_logs.html#) refers to audit logs and security policies.


- [Data Security](sharing_security_overview.html#) refers to which users can see which data in the ThoughtSpot application, and includes:
  -   [Users and Groups](../users_groups/about_users_groups.html#)
  -   [Privileges](../users_groups/about_users_groups.html#privileges-and-groups)
  -   [Table and columns sharing](share_source_tables.html#)
  -   [Row level security](about_row_security.html#)
  -   [Worksheet sharing](share_worksheets.html#)
  -   [Pinboard sharing](share_pinboards.html#)


- Network Security refers to ports for external traffic and traffic within the cluster.  Some ports must remain open for handling network requests from outside the ThoughtSpot instance. To see a list of network ports that must remain open to outside traffic, and for inter-cluster communication, review the information in [Network ports](../setup/firewall_ports.html#).
