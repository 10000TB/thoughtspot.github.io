To make modeling settings for a table you've just loaded, or to make a quick change to existing settings, use the ThoughtSpot web interface. You can adjust the **Columns** settings from the data management listing.

You can change all the same data model settings here as in the model file. This method is easier and faster, unless you need to make many settings in bulk. In that case, [using the model file](edit_model_file.html#) is recommended.

1. Click on the **DATA** icon, to get to the data management listing.
2. Click on the name of your data source.

   ![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/data_management_select_data_source.png "Select a data source")

    This brings up the **Columns** screen, where you'll make your modeling settings.

3. Modify the column settings by clicking on them, typing or selecting the setting you want.
4. Save your changes.

   Descriptions of the different settings are listed in [Data modeling settings](data_modeling_settings.html#).
