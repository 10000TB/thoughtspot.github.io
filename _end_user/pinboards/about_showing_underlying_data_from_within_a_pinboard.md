You can perform many of the same search actions on individual visualizations within a pinboard as you can within a search. You can interact directly with a visualization of a pinboard to perform ad hoc searches or edit it. These search actions include the following:

-   Editing a search - You can edit the original search and reconfigure the answer. In the dropdown of a visualization, click **Edit**.

     ![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/edit_a_pinboard_visualization.png "Edit a pinboard visualization")

    You will be taken to an edit mode, where you can [view and change sources](../end_user_search/about_choosing_sources.html#), [search different columns](../end_user_search/about_the_search_bar.html#), [change the view](../../complex_searches/change_the_view.html#), [save the answer as a worksheet](../../complex_searches/about_query_on_query.html), [add a formula](../../complex_searches/add_formula_to_search.html#), and [change the chart](../end_user_search/change_the_chart.html#).
