There are two separate default administrator users:

|Login Type|User|Access Method|Password|
|----------|----|-------------|--------|
|OS user|`admin`|Used for work that requires sudo or root privileges. Does not exist for application login.|Contact ThoughtSpot to obtain the default password.|
|Application user|`tsadmin`|Access through a Web browser and for non-sudo or root privilege work|Contact ThoughtSpot to obtain the default password. |

Both users can SSH into the an operating system user that you type in at the Linux shell prompt, and an application user for access through a browser. Make sure you use the correct login and password for the method you are using to log in. Passwords are case sensitive.
