    Loops though every collection you defined in _config.yml and grabs the pages they contain; outputting title and full text with good basic html semantics.
    Use page.excerpt instead of page.content to grab the first paragraph, blog list style. Markdownify is optional, depends how you authored content in your collections; I typically use Markdown.
{%  endcomment %}

{% for collection in site.collections %}
    {% if collection.label == 'tooltips' %}
      {% for document in collection.docs%}
        {{document.doc_id}}
      {% endfor %}
    {% endif %}
{% endfor %}
