Congratulations on purchasing ThoughtSpot. You can install a ThoughtSpot cluster
on a hardware appliance or on a hosted AWS or VMWare appliance. Your ThoughtSpot
installation cannot mix types, your installation must be homogenous, so, for
example either hardware or VMWare nodes. This guide instructs you how to prepare
each of the following:

- [Hardware appliance](hardware/inthebox.html)
- [AWS EC2 node](aws/about-aws.html)
- [VMWare node](vmware/vmware-intro.html)

Once you've configured your nodes, you can contact [ThoughtSpot
Support](contact.html) by phone, mail, email, or by filing a support ticket.
