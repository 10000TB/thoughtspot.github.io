GCP can provide memory and CPU for your ThoughtSpot instance, and is easily
updated from development instances.

Your database capacity will determine the number of instances you'll need and
the instance network/storage requirements. In addition, you can go with multiple
VMs based on your dataset size.

The security group setting of your ThoughtSpot instance on GCP is up to you. You
can find more information about which ports to open in the [network ports
reference]({{ site.baseurl }}/appliance/firewall-ports.html#).
