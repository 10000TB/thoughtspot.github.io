Google Cloud Platform (GCP) can provide memory and CPU for your ThoughtSpot
instance, and is easily updated from development instances.

Your database capacity will determine the number of instances you'll need and
the instance network/storage requirements. In addition, you can go with multiple
VMs based on your dataset size.

The security group setting of your ThoughtSpot instance on GCP is up to you. You
can find more information about which ports to open in the [network ports
reference]({{ site.baseurl }}/appliance/firewall-ports.html#).

## A little about GCP

GCP is a secure cloud services platform offered by Google. Using
ThoughtSpot on GCP allows you to easily add instances as your dataset grows.
You can do everything youâ€™d normally want to do in a traditional database center
with GCP. It features an on-demand delivery of IT resources and applications
via the Internet. When you are connected to an instance, you can use it just
like you use any other server.

Using GCP lets you develop and deploy applications faster since there is no need
to manage hardware. Therefore, it is easy to scale and manage computing
capacity.

The ThoughtSpot image deploys on [Google Compute
Engine](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/), the GCP platform for creating
and running virtual machines (_instances_) on Google Cloud infrastructure. GCP
and Google Compute Engine use [Identity and Access Management
(IAM)](https://cloud.google.com/iam/) roles to manage permissions to resources.
Google Compute engine instances and persistent disks are [zonal
resources](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/regions-zones/), and therefore
must be in the same zone to work together.
