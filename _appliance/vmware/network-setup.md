At this point, you should have at least three nodes setup. In this section, you
setup the network on each node.


## Configure the eth0 interface

1. Open a shell on a node.
2. Use the ifconfig command to list the current interfaces.

   You should see something like the following:

   ![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/vmware-network-0.png "Unconfigured network")

3. Identify the values you want to use on the node:

    <table>
    <colgroup>
        <col style="width:15%">
        <col style="width:85%">
     </colgroup>
    <tr>
      <th>Value</th>
      <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>IP Address</th>
      <td>An unclaimed Ip in the network environment, where the host machine is, for example: <code>192.168.2.250</code></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>Netmask</th>
      <td>Use the netmask of the host machine network environment, for example: <code>255.255.255.0</code></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>GATEWAY</th>
      <td>Use the gateway of the host machine network environment, for example: <code>192.168.2.101</code></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>DNS Server 1</th>
      <td>For example, the Google public DNS service: <code>8.8.8.8</code></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>DNS Server 2</th>
      <td>Add your internal DNS if there is any, for example: <code>192.168.2.200</code></td>
    </tr>
    </table>

4. Edit the network configuration file with your favorite editor such as `vi`.

   ```
   sudo vi /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth0
   ```

    You should see something similar to the following:

   ![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/vmware-network-1.png "ifcfg-eth0")

5. Append your configuration values to the file.

    ```
    IPADDR=192.168.2.250
    NETMASK=255.255.255.0
    GATEWAY=192.168.2.101
    DNS1=8.8.8.8
    DNS2=192.168.2.200
    ```

6. Save and exit the file.
7. Restart the network on the system:

   ```
   $ systemctl restart network
   ```

8. Verify that the IP address was set on the interface:

   You should see something like the following:

   ![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/vmware-network-2.png "ifconfig")

9. List the contents of the `rsolv.conf` file to verify that the DNS entry was added.

    ```
    $ cat /etc/resolv.conf
    # Generated by Network Manager
    nameserver 8.8.8.8
    nameserver 192.168.2.200
    ```

10. Verify your work by SSH to the node from outside the VM.

    ```
    $ ssh admin@192.168.2.250
    ```

Repeat this process on the remaining nodes.
