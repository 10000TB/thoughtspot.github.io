# Security policies

ThoughtSpot has security policies in place to ensure a secure product with each release.

When a release is in development, each build is tested using Qualys Network Security and Vulnerability Management Suite. Issues and vulnerabilities are fixed proactively, based on the results.

The ThoughtSpot Engineering and ThoughtSpot Support teams are notified of Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures \(CVEs\), so they can patch OS packages proactively as well. You can [View installed packages](view_installed_packages.html#) along with their version numbers at any time, in order to see if you require an update to ThoughtSpot.

Whenever a CVE is identified, and an OS package needs to be updated, the next patch release will include the patch or update.
