# Add a column description

You can provide a description for a specific column, to provide additional information for users about the data it contains.

**Description** contains an optional description for the corresponding column. When a user hovers over the column, a tooltip will show this description.

To create a column description:

1.   Find the column you want to add a description for, and select its **Description**. 
2.   Type in the column description, as you want it to appear in ThoughtSpot. 
3.   Repeat for all columns where you want to add a description. 
4.   Save your changes.
