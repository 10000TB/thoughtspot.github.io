# Change the schema

After you've created a schema and loaded data, you may find yourself wishing you'd set things up a little differently. You can make changes to the schema, such as changing the primary key, relationships to other tables, and sharding.

Making changes to a schema after data has been loaded and users have created worksheets or pinboards on the tables requires care, so that you don't lose the relationship between the objects created in ThoughtSpot and the underlying tables. If you follow the procedures here, your tables will retain their relationships to the objects created on top of them:

-   [Change the primary key for a table](change_primary_key.html#).
-   [Change a relationship between tables](change_relationships_tql.html#).
-   [Change sharding on a table](change_sharding.html#).
