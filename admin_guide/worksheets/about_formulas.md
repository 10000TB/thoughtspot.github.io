# About formulas in worksheets

You can define formulas and use them to create derived columns in worksheets. You create formulas by combining standard functions and operators, column names, and constant values.

Anyone who can create a worksheet can add a formula to it. Formulas are not reusable; the formula you create is associated only with the worksheet it belongs to.

A complete list of available formulas and examples of each is available in the [Formula reference](../reference/formula_reference.html#).
