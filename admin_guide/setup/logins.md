# Login credentials for administration

You will need administrative permissions to perform the actions discussed in this guide. You can access ThoughtSpot via SSH at the command prompt and from a Web browser.

There are two separate default administrator users, an operating system user that you type in at the Linux shell prompt, and an application user for access through a browser. Make sure you use the correct login and password for the method you are using to log in. Passwords are case sensitive.
