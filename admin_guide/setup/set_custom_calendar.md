# Set up a fiscal calendar year

Many companies start their fiscal calendar in a month other than January. If this is the case in your company, setting a fiscal calendar quarter makes the ThoughtSpot date searches reflect your fiscal year.

When you set a custom fiscal year, you will designate the month on which your company's fiscal year begins. All the date language will then reflect your change, so if someone searches for **this quarter** or **q3**, the answer will conform to the fiscal quarter in use. When you make this change, existing pinboards also change to reflect the custom fiscal calendar. Because of this, if you make this change after your users have been using ThoughtSpot for any period of time, you should alert them of the change you will be making and how it affects previous saved searches.
