Calculating percentages is useful when you want to see, for example, the percentage revenue generated from each channel (online, stores, partner, etc.).

Here is a common percentage example:

## Example

The following example shows you how to figure out the percentage revenue generated from each channel (online, stores, partners, etc.).

1.  Create the following formula in the Formula Builder, percent revenue = ( sum ( revenue ) / group sum ( revenue ) ) \* 100.
2.  Now you can search by each channel, using the percent revenue formula that you just created.
