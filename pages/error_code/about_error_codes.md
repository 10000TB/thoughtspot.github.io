# About error codes

Error codes and messages are shown in ThoughtSpot when something goes wrong. These messages can appear in the application and in logs.

When you see an error code, you will also see a message with a brief summary of what has happened. If there is a remediation action you can take, it will be listed in the [Error code reference](error_codes_reference.html#). If there is no action listed, please contact ThoughtSpot Support.

-   **[Error code reference](../error_code/error_codes_reference.html)**  
This section lists error codes that can appear in ThoughtSpot, with summary information and actions to take.
