# Installation and setup

Here is an overview of the installation and setup information for getting ThoughtSpot on Amazon Web Services (AWS) Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2).

After you've determined your configuration options, you must setup your virtual machines (VMs) using an Amazon Machine Image (AMI). This AMI will be shared with you by ThoughtSpot.

-   **[About the AMI](../../aws/setup/about_the_ami.html)**  
An AMI is a preconfigured template that provides the information required to launch an instance. Check with your ThoughtSpot contact to learn about the latest version of the ThoughtSpot AMI.
-   **[Launch an instance](../../aws/setup/launch_an_instance.html)**  
Follow these steps to set up the VMs and launch ThoughtSpot.
