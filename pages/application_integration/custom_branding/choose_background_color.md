# Choose a background color

You can change the background color to match with your company's theme. The custom background color is in effect when using the API to embed visualizations and pinboards.

This feature is only applicable when embedding ThoughtSpot in an external web portal or application. To choose a background color:

1. Click the background color box under **Application Background**.

2. Use the color menu to choose your new background color.

3. Click the **Reset** button on the upper right hand side of the section if you would like to bring back the default color.
