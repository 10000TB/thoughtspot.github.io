# About SAML

ThoughtSpot can be set up with Security Assertion Markup Language \(SAML\) to enable Single Sign On \(SSO\). SAML can be configured in several ways, including with CA SiteMinder.

For basic instructions on configuring SAML, use one of these procedures:

-   [Configure SAML for SSO](ts_as_sp.html), for instructions to configure SAML in ThoughtSpot.
-   [Configure SAML with CA SiteMinder](configure_SAML_siteminder.html#), for configuring SAML specifically with CA SiteMinder.

-   **[Legacy configure SAML](../../application_integration/SAML/ts_as_sp.html)**  
ThoughtSpot can use Security Assertion Markup Language \(SAML\) to authenticate users. You can set up SAML through the shell on the ThoughtSpot instance.
-   **[Configure SAML](../../application_integration/SAML/configure_SAML_with_tscli.html)**  
ThoughtSpot can use Security Assertion Markup Language \(SAML\) to authenticate users. You can set up SAML through the shell on the ThoughtSpot instance using a tscli based configurator.
-   **[Configure CA SiteMinder](../../application_integration/SAML/configure_SAML_siteminder.html)**  
CA SiteMinder can be used as an Identity Provider for single sign on to ThoughtSpot.
-   **[Configure Active Directory Federated Services](../../application_integration/SAML/integrate_ADFS.html)**  
You can configure Active Directory Federated Services \(AD FS\) to work with ThoughtSpot. This procedure outlines the basic prerequisites and steps to set up AD FS.
