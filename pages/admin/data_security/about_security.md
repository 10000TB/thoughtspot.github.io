-   **[System security](../../admin/data_security/audit_logs.html)**  
ThoughtSpot includes a number of management tools, monitoring applications, and automated processes to support system security. System security includes managing access and privileges, audit logs, security policies, and Linux OS installed package updates.
-   **[Data security](../../admin/data_security/sharing_security_overview.html)**  
Sharing and security settings govern what data a user can access and what they can do with the data. Admins can use these settings to regulate access to information and provide a personalized user experience.
-   **[Network security](../../admin/data_security/network_security.html)**  
This section discusses setting up network security, both for external traffic and traffic within the cluster.
