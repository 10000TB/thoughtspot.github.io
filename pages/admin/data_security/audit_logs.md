ThoughtSpot includes a number of management tools, monitoring applications, and automated processes to support system security. System security includes managing access and privileges, audit logs, security policies, and Linux OS installed package updates.

## Audit logs

There are several ways you can view audit log information in ThoughtSpot. You can see recent events in the Control Center or view more detailed audit logs using tscli. Administrators can view audit logs of configuration changes users have made to ThoughtSpot in these ways:

-   View events from the [Control Center](../system_admin/monitor_pinboards.html#).
-   [Generate audit log reports](get_audit_logs.html#) through tscli.

## Security policies

[Security policies](security_policy.html#) are the principles and processes ThoughtSpot uses in development to ensure a product that conforms to security standards.

-   **[Get audit logs](../../admin/data_security/get_audit_logs.html)**  
You can access an audit log of cluster events through tscli. You can also access information on cluster updates, configurations, data loading and metadata events.
-   **[Security policies](../../admin/data_security/security_policy.html)**  
ThoughtSpot has security policies in place to ensure a secure product with each release.
