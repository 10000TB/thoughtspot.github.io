You can create stickers for use in tagging pinboards, worksheets, and data sources.

Only administrator users can create stickers. Anyone can apply the stickers you create, or use them as filters when selecting from a list of sources or pinboards.

To create a sticker:

1.   Navigate to the **Manage Data** or **Pinboards** screen using the icons in the top navigation bar.
2.   Choose **Select sticker**, scroll to the bottom of the list, and click **+ Add**.
