Modeling, tagging, and adding links between your data sources can make the data even easier to search.

You can start searching your data without doing any modeling, creating relationships, or tagging. But putting some thought into these will make the data even easier and more intuitive to search for your end users.

-   **[Model the data for searching](../../admin/data_modeling/semantic_modeling.html)**  
After loading data, you will create the semantic data model that makes the data easy to search. You can make these settings either through the Web interface or by using the model file.
-   **[Link tables using relationships](../../admin/data_modeling/about_relationships.html)**  
You can link tables by creating relationships between their columns. Linked tables can be searched together or combined into a worksheet for easy searching. Tables that have no relationship between their columns can not be combined in a single search.
-   **[About stickers](../../admin/data_modeling/stickers_concept.html)**  
 You can create stickers to make it easier for people to find data sources and pinboards.
