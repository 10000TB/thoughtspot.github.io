After downloading the model file, you'll make changes to the settings using this procedure. Then you will upload the file again to apply your changes.

You can edit any of the values in the model file, except for those where the words **DoNotModify** appear below the column header. To make changes in the model file:

1.   Open the model file you downloaded \(model.xls\) in Excel, vi/vim, or a text editor.
    -   If you are using Excel, you may see a warning message. Click **Yes** to proceed.

    -   If your model file includes multi-byte characters, edit the file using vi or vim. This is because model files containing multi-byte characters must be saved as UTF-8 encoded. Otherwise you won't be able to upload them after making your edits.
2.   Find the column you want to modify. Descriptions of the meanings of the columns are listed in [Data modeling settings](data_modeling_settings.html#).
3.   Select the value you want to change.
4.   Type in the new value.
5.   After making all your changes, save the model file.
    -   If you are using Excel, you will see a message. Click **Yes** to save the file.
