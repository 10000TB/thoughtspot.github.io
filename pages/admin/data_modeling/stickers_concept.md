You can create stickers to make it easier for people to find data sources and pinboards. Stickers are global in scope. This means that everyone can see the stickers and use them to tag objects. They can also filter lists of objects by sticker. Stickers are often used to designate subject areas, such as sales, HR, and finance, but you can use them any way you like.

Keep in mind these permissions when working with stickers:

- Only administrators can create stickers.
- Anyone can apply a sticker.
- Anyone can filter by a sticker.
