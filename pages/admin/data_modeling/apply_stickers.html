# Apply a sticker

Apply a sticker whenever you want to tag a data source, worksheet, or pinboard to make it easier to find.

Only administrators create stickers, but anyone with edit privileges can tag an object with a sticker.

To tag an object with a sticker:

1.   From the top menu, choose Answers, Pinboards, or Data.

2.   Find the item\(s\) you want to tag in the list, and check the box next to its name. 
3.   Click the apply sticker icon and choose one from the list. You can apply as many stickers as you like to an object.
