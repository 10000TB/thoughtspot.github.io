# Delete a relationship

If you created a relationship \(link\) between tables using the Web interface, you can also delete it from the Web interface. But if the relationship was created using TQL, you must also use TQL to delete it.

You must have either administration privilege or modify access permission to the columns to delete a relationship.

To delete a relationship using [TQL](../reference/sql_cli_commands.html#), use an ALTER TABLE...DROP FOREIGN KEY... statement.

To delete a relationship from the Web interface:

1.   Click on the **Data** icon on the top navigation bar and then on **Worksheets**.

3.  Select **Relationships**.
