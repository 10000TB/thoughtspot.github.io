# Change the column name

You can change the text that is shown for the column names in ThoughtSpot to make the names more meaningful to users. The column name is what they will type to add that column to their search.

**Column Name** is the name that will be displayed to users for that column in ThoughtSpot. The default is the name you gave the column when you defined the table in the database or imported the CSV file from the browser.

1.   Find the **Column Name** for the column whose name you want to change. 
2.   Type in the new column name, as you want it to appear in ThoughtSpot. 
3.   Save your changes.
