You have the ability to join an aggregated worksheet with a table.

Previously you could only join aggregated worksheets with other aggregated worksheets. Now, you can join an aggregated worksheet with a system table by creating a relationship. This means aggregated worksheets now behave similar to tables, and they can be used in the same way as a table, excluding any TQL manipulation.

You also have the capability to create a worksheet on top of an aggregated worksheet. So aggregated worksheets can be included as tables in regular worksheets.
