# Connect to the ThoughtSpot Support file server

ThoughtSpot Support uses a secure file server to provide new releases and to receive logs and troubleshooting files that you upload. The secure server connection is also required if you want to enable the optional statistics collection using the call home feature.

Before you can upload a file to the secure file server, obtain your user name and password for logging in to the secure file server. You can get these from ThoughtSpot Support.

Configuring the connection to the file server is a one time operation. You do not need to reconfigure the connection unless your password changes. Note that you can do a one time override of the user and password you used to configure the connection. This is done by passing a different user and password on the command line when uploading or downloading a file.

To configure the connection to the secure file server:

1.   [Log in to the Linux shell using SSH](login_console.html#). 
2.   Issue the command to configure the file server: 

    ```
    $ tscli fileserver configure --user <user\_name> [--password <password>]
    ```

    Note that if you do not use the optional `--password` parameter, you will be prompted to enter the password.
