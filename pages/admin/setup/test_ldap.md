# Test the LDAP configuration

After configuring LDAP, you can test to make sure it is working by issuing a command.

This procedure allows you to test the LDAP connection you created.

1.   [Log in to the Linux shell using SSH](login_console.html#). 
2.   Issue the LDAP testing command, supplying the information for the LDAP server you configured, as in this example: 

    ```
    $ ldapsearch -x -h 192.168.2.61 -p 389 -D "testuser@ldap.thoughtspot.com" -W -b "dc=ldap,dc=thoughtspot,dc=com" cn
    ```

3.   Supply the LDAP password when prompted. 
4.   If the connection works, you'll see a confirmation message.
