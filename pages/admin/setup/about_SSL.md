# About SSL \(secure socket layers\)

You should use SSL \(secure socket layers\) for sending data to and from ThoughtSpot. SSL provides authentication and data security. This section applies to both SSL to enable secure HTTP and secure LDAP.

Many IT departments require SSL for their applications that access data. To use SSL with ThoughtSpot, you'll need your company's own SSL certificate. The certificate is issued per domain, so if you want to use SSL for both HTTP and LDAP, you will need two separate certificates - one for the HTTP domain and one for the LDAP domain.

If you do not have an SSL certificate:

-   Check with your IT department to see if they already have an SSL certificate you can use.
-   If not, you will need to obtain the certificate from an issuing authority.
-   Alternatively, you may disable SSL if you don't want the security it provides by using the command `tscli ssl off`.

There are many SSL vendors to choose from. Check with your existing Web hosting provider first, to see if they can provide the certificate for you.

When you apply for the SSL certificate, you may specify a SAN, wildcard, or single domain certificate. Any of these can work with ThoughtSpot.

This procedure shows how to add SSL \(secure socket layers\) to enable secure HTTP \(HTTPS\) in ThoughtSpot.
-   **[Set the recommended TLS version](../../admin/setup/set_the_recommended_tls_version.html)**  
There are a couple of security vulnerabilities due to SSL certificates supporting older versions of TLS \(Transport Layer Security\). This procedure shows you how to set the recommended TLS version to avoid these vulnerabilities.
