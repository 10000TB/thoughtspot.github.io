# Send logs to the administrator

Alternately, you can easily send log files directly to your administrator with a single click.

When ThoughtSpot encounters a problem, a red bar displays in the browser with an error message. You can use the **Report Problem** option to complete this task.

1.   Click **Report Problem** in the bottom right corner of the error message. 

     ![](../../images/trace_log.png "Report problem") 

    The logs will be sent to your administrator as an email attachment from your email account. Your administrator then has the option to followup with ThoughtSpot, if necessary.
