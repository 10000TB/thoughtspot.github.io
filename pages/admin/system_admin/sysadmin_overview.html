# System administration

System administration includes applying upgrades, backing up and restoring the cluster, snapshotting, and adding or removing nodes.

## Administration tools

Use these tools to perform administrative actions:

-   [tscli](../reference/tscli_command_ref.html#): an administrative command line interface.
-   [tsload](../reference/data_importer_ref.html#): a command for loading data directly into the database.
-   [TQL](../reference/sql_cli_commands.html#): a command line SQL interface to interact with databases.

-   **[System monitoring](../../admin/system_admin/monitor_pinboards.html)**  
System monitoring tools in ThoughtSpot include the Control Center, system log files and out-of-the-box system monitoring pinboards.
-   **[Generate and send a log bundle](../../admin/system_admin/generate_log_bundle.html)**  
Use theses steps to generate a log bundle, which you can then send to ThoughtSpot Support.
-   **[Send logs to the administrator](../../admin/system_admin/send_logs_to_administrator.html)**  
Alternately, you can easily send log files directly to your administrator with a single click.
-   **[Set up recording for Replay Search](../../admin/system_admin/configure_record_search.html)**  
Only administrator users can record the **Replay Search** using the ThoughtSpot application. You can use the recording to create training for your users on how to search your own data.
