# Work with snapshots

A snapshot is a point-in-time image of your running cluster you can use to restore the cluster back to a specific point in time. In this section, you learn how to work with the default snapshot configuration that is enabled on ever cluster and how to take manual snapshots of your own.

-   **[Create a manual snapshot](../../admin/backup_restore/take_snapshot.html)**  
You should create a snapshot before making any changes to the environment, loading a large amount of new data, or changing the structure of a table. If you would like to restore from a snapshot instead, contact ThoughtSpot Support.
-   **[Manage periodic snapshots](../../admin/backup_restore/configure_periodic_snapshots.html)**  
By default, each ThoughtSpot cluster is configured to take automatic, periodic snapshots of your cluster. This section explains how to learn more about the periodic snapshots in your cluster.
