After adding a group, you can always go in and change its settings to add or revoke privileges. The new settings will apply to all the group members.

To edit or delete an existing group:

1.   [Log in to ThoughtSpot from a browser](../setup/accessing.html#).
2.   Click on the **Admin** icon, on the top navigation bar.

3.  In the **Admin** panel, click on **User Management** and **Groups**.

4.   Find the group you want to edit in the list and click its name, or the edit icon ![](../../images/edit_icon.png). If you don't see the name of the group, try searching for it.

    You can also delete a group from this page by clicking the **Delete** icon. Deleting a group does not delete its users.

5.   Make your changes and click **Update**.
