# Manage users, groups, and privileges

Before people can log in and use ThoughtSpot, you need to create a username, a password, and a membership in one or more groups for them. Creating groups and assigning users to them makes privilege management easier.

## Ways of managing users and groups

This section describes manual creation of users, groups, and privileges, but you can also manage users through [LDAP](../setup/about_LDAP.html#) or SAML. For information on setting up SAML authentication, see the ThoughtSpot Application Integration Guide.

## The "All" group

There is a default group called **All**, which includes every user in ThoughtSpot. When you create a new user, they will be added to the **All** group automatically. You cannot delete the **All** group or remove members from it.

## Privileges

Privileges determine what kinds of actions users are allowed to do. Plan your groups so that you can use them to assign a common set of privileges to multiple users. Privileges are set at the group level. For more information on the privileges you can assign and how to assign them, see [About privileges](about_privileges.html#).

## Nested groups \(groups within groups\)

You can also have a hierarchy of groups. That is, groups can belong to \(i.e. be children of\) other groups. When using group hierarchies, permissions are inherited from the parent group. So if you're a member of a sub-group, you would automatically have the privileges of the parent group.

-   **[About privileges](../../admin/users_groups/about_privileges.html)**  
You can assign privileges at the group level. Then you create users and assign them to groups. This is how you grant users access to different capabilities in ThoughtSpot.
-   **[Add a group and set security privileges](../../admin/users_groups/add_group.html)**  
Before adding users, create the groups they will belong to. Each group includes a set of privileges for its users. Good planning when creating groups and assigning privileges will pay off in ease of administration and a better search experience.
-   **[Edit or delete a group](../../admin/users_groups/edit_group.html)**  
After adding a group, you can always go in and change its settings to add or revoke privileges. The new settings will apply to all the group members.
-   **[Add a user](../../admin/users_groups/add_user.html)**  
You will create a user account for each unique person who will access ThoughtSpot, either manually or through LDAP. This procedure shows how to creating a user manually.
-   **[Add multiple users to a group](../../admin/users_groups/add_multiple_users_to_a_group.html)**  
You can add multiple users to a group using one button.
-   **[Edit or delete a user](../../admin/users_groups/edit_user.html)**  
After a user has been created, you can always go back and change their settings, for example to change their group memberships or change their password.
-   **[Forgotten password](../../admin/users_groups/forgot_password.html)**  
If a user forgets their password, you can reset it by editing the user.
