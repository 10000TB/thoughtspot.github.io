You create formulas by combining standard functions and operators, column names, and constant values.

Anyone who can create a worksheet can add a formula to it. Formulas are not reusable; the formula you create is associated only with the worksheet it belongs to. A complete list of available formulas and examples of each is available in the [Formula reference](/pages/reference/formula_reference.html#).

You can create a formula in a worksheet by using the Formula Builder. When you do this, the result of the formula gets added to the worksheet as a column. Use these steps to create a formula:

1. [Create a new worksheet](worksheet_create.html#), or [edit an existing one](edit_worksheet.html#).
2. Click the **+** button next to **Formulas**.

3. Type your formula in the Formula Builder.

    **Note:** Formulas elements are color coded by type and can include the formula operators and functions​ (blue), the names of columns (purple)​, and/or constants​ (black).

4. If you want to change what your formula returns, use the **Advanced settings**.Depending on your formula, you may be able to change:

    -   Data type
    -   ATTRIBUTE or MEASURE
    -   Aggregation type

5.  You can see a list of formula operators with examples by clicking on **Formula Assistant.**

6. Name the formula by clicking on its title and typing the new name. Click **Save**.
