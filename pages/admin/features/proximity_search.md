summary: "If your table contains Latitude and Longitude data, you can use proximity searches that find entities related to each other by location."

Proximity keywords allow you to search with spatial filters on data contained in a table or worksheet which contains geo type columns with latitude/longitude data. This lets you search based on spherical distance. The distance is calculated as a straight-line distance (not road distance) radius using miles, kilometers, or meters from the central point. If not specified, the default is 10 km.

{% include note.html content="The latitude and longitude data have to be on the same base tables for the feature to work." %}

If you want to be able to use proximity keywords the data source (worksheet or one of the tables) must contain a column of type longitude and a column of type latitude. Also, your administrators must have configured these columns using the appropriate GeoType. The proximity keywords are.

-   `near`
-   `nearâ€¦within n miles|km|meters`
-   `farther than n miles|km|meters from`

These keywords:

-   work on duplicate counties
-   can be filtered on
-   display a circle that represents your set distance on the geo charts when you filter on a GeoType column
-   are limited to 33 latitude/longitude pairs
