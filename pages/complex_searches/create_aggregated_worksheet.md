# Save a search as a worksheet

This procedure walks you through creating a worksheet from a search.

To create a worksheet from a search (i.e. an aggregated worksheet):

1.   Start a new search, or edit an existing visualization from a pinboard. Any filters or aggregations created during this search will be reflected in the worksheet.
2.   If you want to use a different aggregation than the default one for any column, set it from the column header.

3.   Save the answer as a **Worksheet**.
