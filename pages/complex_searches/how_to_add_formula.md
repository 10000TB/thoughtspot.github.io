# Add a formula to a search

You can add a formula directly within a search. Some common reasons for using a formula in a search are to perform mathematical functions, check for and replace null values, or add if...then...else logic.

To create a formula in a search:

1.   Start a new search, or choose an existing answer from a pinboard to edit. 
2.   If the answer shows a chart, switch to **Data View**. 

     ![](/pages/images/toggle_between_views.png "Switch to Data View") 

3.   In the upper right hand side of the table, click **Actions** and select **Add formula**.

4.   Type your formula in the Formula Builder. 

     ![](../../shared/conrefs//pages/images/formula_builder.png "Use the Formula Builder") 

    **Note:** Formulas elements are color coded by type and can include the formula operators and functions​ (blue), the names of columns (purple)​, and/or constants​ (black).

5.  You can see a list of formula operators with examples by clicking on **Formula Assistant.**

6.  If you want to change what your formula returns, use the **Advanced settings**.Depending on your formula, you may be able to change:

    -   Data type
    -   ATTRIBUTE or MEASURE
    -   Aggregation type

7. Name the formula by clicking on its title and typing the new name. Click **Save**.
