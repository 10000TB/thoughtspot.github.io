# About formula support for chasm trap schemas

You can create a formula that involves aggregated measures coming from multiple fact tables of a chasm trap.

Just as you would create any other formula, you can create a formula that spans across a chasm trap. The Formula Builder will provide column suggestions for formulas that span across chasm traps.
