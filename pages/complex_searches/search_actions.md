You can change the view of your answer so it appears as a table or a chart.
-   **[Sort your search](../../pages/complex_searches/sort_your_search.html)**  
Sorting your search allows you to order your answer, making it easier to read.
-   **[Change the date bucketing](../../pages/end_user_guide/end_user_search/change_the_date_bucketing.html)**  
You can change the date bucketing on tables and charts for columns with date values.
-   **[Show underlying data](../../pages/complex_searches/show_underlying_data.html)**

You can make a copy of an answer if you would like to make edits without changing the original answer.
