# View or edit a formula in a search

You can always go back and view or edit a formula that has been added to a search. Do this by clicking the edit icon next to its name in the **Columns** listing.

Anyone who has edit privileges on an answer can also edit any formulas it contains. To view or edit an existing formula in an answer:

1.   Navigate to the pinboard that contains the answer with the formula, and open it. 
2.   Scroll down to the bottom of the **Columns** listing. You will see a data source called **Formulas**. 
3.   Expand **Formulas**, and you'll see a list of all the formulas in this answer.

6.   Click **Save** to save the formula with your changes.
