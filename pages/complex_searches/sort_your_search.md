# Sort your search

Sorting your search allows you to order your answer, making it easier to read.

By default, sorting applies in descending order. You can click on a column header to sort again to sort in ascending order.

To sort your search:

1.   If you are in the data (table) view, click the column header you would like to sort on. 

    **Tip:** Hold shift and click another column to add a secondary sort. You can even add tertiary sorting and so on by continuing to use this trick.

2.   If you are in the chart view, click the axis label of your chart and select **Sort**.
