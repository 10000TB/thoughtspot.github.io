# Calculate the cumulative sum

You can use the cumulative function in a search to measure from the start of your data to the current point.

This example will demonstrate using the cumulative_sum formula, also known as a running total. To use the cumulative function in a search:

1.   Start a new search. 

     ![](../../images/aggregation_answer.png "Aggregation Answer example") 

2.   In the upper right hand side of the table, click **Actions** and select **Add formula**.

3.   Enter the cumulative_sum formula, providing a measure and one or more attributes. The example will return the sum of revenue, accumulated by the commit date.

4.   Name the formula by clicking on its title and typing the new name. Click **Save**. 
5. The formula will appear in the search bar and in the table as its own column.

    A headline box displaying the cumulative sum within the entire table will appear at the bottom. You can click on it to toggle between different aggregations.
