# About the hardware

There are two different appliance hardware platforms on which ThoughtSpot's Analytical Search engine is deployed, Ivy Bridge and Haswell. Both of the platforms provide the same performance. The physical differences between the platforms are detailed below.

|Details|Ivy Bridge|Haswell|
|-------|----------|-------|
|**Dimensions**|2 RU chassis \(17.25 x 3.47 x 26.75 in.\)|2 RU chassis \(17.25 x 3.47 x 28.5 in., 2‚Äù longer than Ivy Bridge\)|
|**\# of nodes**|Populated with 3 or 4 nodes|Populated with 1 to 4 nodes|
|**Node specifications**|Each node is independent and consists of a server board \(removable from rear\), 1x 120GB SSD, 5x 1TB HDD|Each node is independent and consists of a server board \(removable from rear\), 1x 200GB SSD, 3x 2TB HDD|
|**Max power consumption**|1620 W|2000 W|
|**Required power input**|120-140 V / 12-10A / 50-60Hz, 180-240V / 10.5-8 A / 50-60Hz|200-240 / 11.8 - 9.8A / 50-60Hz|

**Note:** Required connections are the same for each platform.

-   **[Hardware front and rear view diagrams](../../appliance/physical/hardware_front_and_rear_view_diagrams.html)**  
These diagrams show the front and rear chassis views. The marked features are present on all four nodes on the rear of the chassis even though they are only pointed out on one node in the diagrams.
