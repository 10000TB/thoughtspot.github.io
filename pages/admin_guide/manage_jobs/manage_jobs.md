# Manage jobs

The Jobs Management page found on the Admin section in the ThoughtSpot web application allows you to create and manage jobs, namely scheduled pinboards.

All jobs on your cluster will appear on the Jobs Management page. You can also view jobs for individual pinboards under the pinboard Actions dropdown.
