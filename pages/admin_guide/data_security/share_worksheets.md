# Share worksheets

You can share worksheets with users or with groups. Sharing a worksheet allows users to select it as a data source and search it.

A worksheet can be shared by the owner of the worksheet, or by an administrator. Users can start searching a worksheet as soon as the worksheet is shared with them.

When you share a worksheet, all of its columns are shared. Sharing a worksheet does not share the underlying tables. If you want to share the underlying tables, see [Share tables and columns](share_source_tables.html#).

1.   Click on the **Data** icon on the top navigation bar and then on **Worksheets**.

    -   **Can View** to provide read-only access. Enables viewing the worksheet and searching on it.
    -   **Can Edit** to allow modification. Enables renaming, modifying filters, or deleting the worksheet and adding or removing its columns. To add columns to a worksheet a user needs access to the underlying table.
5.   Click **Add and Save**. 
6.   Click **Done**.
