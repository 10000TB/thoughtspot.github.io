# Model the data for searching

After loading data, you will create the semantic data model that makes the data easy to search. You can make these settings either through the Web interface or by using the model file.

## About data modeling

Data modeling is a very lightweight process compared to what you may have experienced in other tools. It enables you to change some of the settings \(or properties\) of the data so that it becomes more searchable.

You can change these settings in two ways, both of which have the same effect:

1.  [Model data in the Web interface.](../../shared/conrefs/../../admin_guide/data_modeling/model_data_in_UI.html)
2.  [Model data in bulk in the model file.](../../shared/conrefs/../../admin_guide/data_modeling/edit_model_file.html#)

Choose the model file method if you want to make many changes in one bulk operation.

Modeling the data allows you to give the columns more search friendly names or predefine how they can be explored and aggregated. When you load data, most of this data modeling metadata is set up for you automatically. However, since you know your data best, you can adjust the modeling settings to improve the experience for your users.
