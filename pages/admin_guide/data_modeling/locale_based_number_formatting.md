# Locale-based number formatting

Number formatting is set by default based on your browser locale setting. This has been set in order to accommodate users in various geographical locations, primarily in the US and Europe regions.

For example, if you are using ThoughtSpot in the US, the number formatting should look like this: xxx,xxx.xx. And in Europe, it should look like this: xxx.xxx,xx.
