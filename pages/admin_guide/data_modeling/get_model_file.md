# Download the model file

Before you can make changes to the model file, you need to download it. Then you can edit it using Microsoft Excel, vi/vim, or a similar text editing tool.

First, you'll download the model file, and then make changes to the appropriate [Data modeling settings](data_modeling_settings.html#). To obtain the model file:

1.   [Log in to ThoughtSpot from a browser](../setup/accessing.html#) as an Administrator user. 
2.   Click on the **Admin** icon, on the top navigation bar.
