# About stickers

You can create stickers to make it easier for people to find data sources and pinboards.

## About stickers

Stickers enable you to create categories for classification of objects, including pinboards, answers, data sources, and worksheets. Only administrators can create stickers, and they are global in scope. This means that everyone can see the stickers and use them to tag objects. They can also filter lists of objects by sticker. Stickers are often used to designate subject areas, such as sales, HR, and finance, but you can use them any way you like.

This is the workflow for using stickers:

1.  Only administrators can create stickers.
2.  Anyone can [Apply a sticker](apply_stickers.html#).
3.  Anyone can [Filter by a sticker](filter_by_sticker.html#).
