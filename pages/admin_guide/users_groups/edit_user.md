# Edit or delete a user

After a user has been created, you can always go back and change their settings, for example to change their group memberships or change their password.

As an administrator, you can edit a user and change the groups the user belongs to. You can also edit a user to reset a userâ€™s password by entering and confirming the new password. This is useful if a user has forgotten their password, or to effectively disable an account.

To edit an existing user:

1.   [Log in to ThoughtSpot from a browser](../setup/accessing.html#). 
2.   Click on the **Admin** icon, on the top navigation bar.

3.  In the **Admin** panel, click on **User Management** and **Users**.

     ![](../../shared/conrefs/../../images/manage_users_3.2.png "Manage Users") 

4.   Find the user you want to edit in the list and click on its name or the edit icon ![](../../images/edit_icon.png). If you don't see the name of the user, try searching for it. 

    You can also delete a user from this page by clicking the **Delete** icon.

5.   Make your changes and click **Save**.
