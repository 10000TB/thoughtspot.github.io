# Installation and setup

This ThoughtSpot Administrator Guide will walk you through the basic steps required to set up and configure ThoughtSpot. It will also assist you in troubleshooting some common problems, finding additional resources, and contacting ThoughtSpot.

ThoughtSpot enables you to access and analyze your data through a search-based user interface. You can create your searches on the fly by typing into a search bar, like you do when using an internet search engine. ThoughtSpot makes it easy to see your data, get your questions answered, create interactive graphs, and customize pinboards. You do not need to understand how the data is stored or know SQL to do these things.

ThoughtSpot gives administrators the ability to modify data properties to meet business needs, for example by providing search synonyms for common terms, boosting the importance of a column in search results, or formatting how the data appears. Collaboration and security features make it easy for you to protect sensitive data and for users to share information safely with others.
