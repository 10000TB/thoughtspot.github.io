# About changing the schema \(DDL\)

You can view and edit the DDL script that gets generated by ThoughtSpot Data Connect. This allows you to review the table that will be created and make changes to the SQL that generates it.

Some common changes you can make to the DDL before you first run the data load are:

-   Edit the DDL script to point to an existing table in ThoughtSpot. The columns and their order must exactly match that of the existing table. You can check the columns and their order by issuing the `SCRIPT TABLE <table\_name>` command from TQL. You may need to rearranged the order of columns in the generated DDL so that it matches the order of the target table.
-   Create the table\(s\) in a different schema than what the default DDL suggests.
-   Add sharding using the `PARTITION BY HASH (<number>) <column>` syntax.
