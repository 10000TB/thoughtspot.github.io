# Login credentials for administration

You will need administrative permissions to perform the actions discussed in this guide. You can access ThoughtSpot via SSH at the command prompt and from a Web browser.

There are two separate default administrator users, an operating system user that you type in at the Linux shell prompt, and an application user for access through a browser. Make sure you use the correct login and password for the method you are using to log in. Passwords are case sensitive.

|Login Type|User|Access Method|Password|
|----------|----|-------------|--------|
|OS user|admin|[Access remotely via SSH from the command prompt on a client machine.](login_console.html#)|Contact ThoughtSpot to obtain the default password.|
|Application user|tsadmin|[Access through a Web browser.](accessing.html#)|Contact ThoughtSpot to obtain the default password.|

-   **[Log in to ThoughtSpot from a browser](../../../data_connect/data_connect/reference/accessing.html)**  
To set up and explore your data, access ThoughtSpot from a standard Web browser using a username and password.
-   **[Log in to the Linux shell using SSH](../../../data_connect/data_connect/reference/login_console.html)**  
To perform basic administration such as checking network connectivity, starting and stopping services, and setting up email, log in remotely as the Linux administrator user "admin". To log in with SSH from a client machine, you can use the command shell or a utility like Putty.
