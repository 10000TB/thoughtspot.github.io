# Copy an answer

You can make a copy of an answer if you would like to make edits without changing the original answer.

1.   Click on **Answers**, on the top navigation bar. 

     ![](/pages/images/answers_icon.png "Answers") 

2.   On the answer list page, click the answer you would like to copy. 
3.   Click **Actions** and select **Make a copy**. 

     ![](/pages/images/copy_an_answer.png "Make a copy of the answer") 

4.   Give your answer a new name and description. Then click **Save**.
