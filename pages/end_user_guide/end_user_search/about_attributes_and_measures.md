# About attributes and measures

Searches in ThoughtSpot use columns that are defined as either attributes or measures.

ThoughtSpot identifies search columns as either attributes or measures. For several chart types, your search needs to contain a certain number of attributes and a certain number of measures.

## Attributes

Attribute are primarily text or date values. Attributes make up the x-axis of your chart most of time. Some examples of attributes in terms of a person include name, eye color, occupation, social security number, address, employee ID, and phone number.

## Measures

Measures are numeric values you can do math on, with meaningful results. You will most likely find your measures on the y-axis of your chart. Some examples of measures in terms of a person are age, height, and weight.
