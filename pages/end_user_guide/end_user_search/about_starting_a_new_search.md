# About starting a new search

There are a few basic things you should understand before starting a new ThoughtSpot search.

## How do I search data?

You’ve probably seen one of these before:

 ![](../../../images/search_bar_blank.png "Search bar") 

Click in the box and start typing some letters. As soon as you begin typing, search suggestions appear. Type slowly and use the suggestions to find what you're looking for.

Whenever you finish typing a word, you'll see an answer in the form of a chart or a table.

You should know that search in ThoughtSpot is more like an Amazon search than a conversation. For example. Instead of:

```
Find me all books by Lewis Carroll with the title Alice in Wonderland
```

You'd type:

```
carroll alice
```

Or consider Google. You wouldn’t type in:

```
Find me the largest city by population
```

You’d type:

```
largest city by population
```

or simply:

```
largest city population
```

That’s how search works in ThoughtSpot. You can use some helping words like “by” and “for” but they can also be left out, and the search will return the same answer.

## What kinds of things can I type?

Search is based on the tables that exist in your data. Tables are made of rows and columns, like spreadsheets.

So you can search by typing in any of these words:

-   The column name: like revenue, product name, or store
-   Any of the values in the columns: like 20000, kitten chow, or richmond
-   One of the special [keywords](../end_user_reference/keyword_reference.html#) ThoughtSpot understands: like yesterday, \>, or contains

Searches in ThoughtSpot use columns that are defined as either attributes or measures.
-   **[What am I looking at?](../../../pages/end_user_guide/end_user_search/what_am_i_looking_at_.html)**  
After, or while completing a search, you can see how ThoughtSpot came up with the answer.
