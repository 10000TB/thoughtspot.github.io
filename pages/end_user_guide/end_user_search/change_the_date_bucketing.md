# Change the date bucketing

You can change the date bucketing on tables and charts for columns with date values.

The default date bucketing takes the entire search result into account. For example, if your search includes last month, dates will be bucketed daily instead of monthly. You can change this default bucketing choice.

To change the date bucketing:

1.   Click the date bucket dropdown on the column header of your table or on the axis label of your chart.

2.   Select a different date bucket.
