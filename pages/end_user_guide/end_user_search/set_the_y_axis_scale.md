# Set the y-axis range

You can manually set the y-axis range by using the **Edit chart configuration** icon.

The chart configuration panel includes the option to manually set the y-axis range.

To set the y-axis range:

1.   While viewing your answer as a chart, click **Edit chart configuration** near the top right. 

     ![](/pages/images/edit_chart_configuration.png "Edit chart configuration icon") 

2.   Under **Y-Axis Range** enter your preferred start and end values. 

     ![](/pages/images/y_axis_range.png "Y-Axis Range details") 

    Your chart will reorganize itself to reflect the new y-axis range.
