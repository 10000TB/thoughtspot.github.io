# Funnel charts

The funnel chart shows a process with progressively decreasing proportions amounting to 100 percent in total.

This chart is similar to a stacked percent column chart, and is often used to represent stages in a sales process. You can visualize the progression of data as it passes from one phase to another. Data in each of these phases is represented as different proportions.
