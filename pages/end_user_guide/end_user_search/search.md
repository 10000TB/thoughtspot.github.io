# About search

Use search to get instant answers about your data without having to consult a data analyst.

Using ThoughtSpot's relational search is simple, so anyone can use it. In the search bar, type what you are interested in exploring, for example `revenue midwest sales rep`. ThoughtSpot will return an answer based on your searched terms.

As you get better with ThoughtSpot's search tools, you will be able to get more out of your data by performing more complex searches. For more information on complex searches, refer to the ThoughtSpot Advanced Searches Guide.
