# About tables

Tables display your answer in a format similar to an Excel spreadsheet.

Your search is not limited by the number of attributes or columns in order to be presented as a table. You can have a table with just one attribute or measure. When you choose to display your answer as a table, ThoughtSpot will create the columns for you and any relevant [headlines](about_headlines.html#).

Sometimes when you view a table, the results will be aggregated (combined). For example, if you only type "revenue", you'll see the total sum of all the revenue the table contains as one combined number. If you include the keyword "monthly", the results will be aggregated by month.
You can rearrange the column order of your table among other search actions.

Every table gives you the option to rearrange the column order and change the column widths.
