# Resize column widths

You can resize the column widths of your table after adding all of your search terms.

Any adjustments you make to the column widths of your table are saved when you pin the table to a pinboard.

To resize the column widths:

1.   While viewing your answer as a table, hover over a column border in the column header row. 
2.   Click and drag the border to create your preferred column width.
