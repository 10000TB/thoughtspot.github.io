# About pinboards

Pinboards act like live dashboards, and are collections of your related charts, tables, and headline.

You can pin charts and tables to any pinboard which you created, and those that have been shared with you with the **Edit** privilege. When you create a pinboard, you can share it with other people with either the **View** or **Edit** privilege. Pinboards are interactive, allowing you to perform actions like filtering, excluding values, and drilldown on the visualizations.

-   **[Create a pinboard](../../../pages/end_user_guide/pinboards/create_a_pinboard.html)**  
Create a new pinboard to group and manage related search results.
-   **[Add an answer to a pinboard](../../../pages/end_user_guide/pinboards/add_an_answer_to_a_pinboard.html)**  
Instead of saving an answer you can add it to a pinboard by pinning it.
-   **[Edit the layout of a pinboard](../../../pages/end_user_guide/pinboards/edit_the_layout_of_a_pinboard.html)**  
Editing the layout of a pinboard lets you snap visualizations into place, choose between set visualization sizes, and reset your layout.
-   **[About pinboard filters](../../../admin/complex_searches/about_pinboard_filters.html)**  
Filters, including bulk filters, can be applied to pinboards just as with tables and charts. These kinds of filters apply to an entire pinboard, making it easy to see only the data that you are interested in across the tables and charts within a pinboard.
-   **[About scheduled pinboards](../../../admin/manage_jobs/about_scheduled_pinboards.html)**  
You can get pinboards emailed to you on a regular basis and do analysis offline. This introduces an additional format for you to consume and share pinboards with others, including those who donâ€™t have a ThoughtSpot account.
-   **[Other pinboard actions](../../../pages/end_user_guide/pinboards/pinboard_actions.html)**  
Other pinboard actions include actions you normally perform on your search as well as actions that you can only perform on a pinboard.
