# Add an answer to a pinboard

Instead of saving an answer you can add it to a pinboard by pinning it.

To add an answer to a pinboard:

1.   While viewing your answer of interest, click the **Pin** icon on the top right of the answer. 

     ![](/pages/images/add_to_pinboard.png "Pin an answer to a pinboard icon") 

2.   In the Copy to pinboard(s) dialog box, click the **+** icons next to the pinboards you would like to add your answer to. 

     ![](/pages/images/copy_to_pinboard.png "Add filters menu") 

    **Tip:** You can also select **Create new pinboard** at the top of the list to create a new pinboard, then add your answer to it.
