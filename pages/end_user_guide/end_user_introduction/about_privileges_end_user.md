# Understanding privileges

The things you can do in ThoughtSpot are determined by the privileges you have. These are set at the group level.

If you are trying to do something in ThoughtSpot, and cannot access the screens to accomplish it, you may not have the correct privileges. In this case, you should contact your administrator and explain what you want to accomplish. Your administrator may be able to grant you additional privileges.

**Note:** Permissions to see and edit tables, worksheets, and pinboards are not affected by privileges. They are given when these itmes are shared with you.

Here are the privileges that the administrator sets, and the capabilities they enable:

|Privilege|Description|
