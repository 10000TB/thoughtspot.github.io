# Working with data

The **Data** tab takes you to a list page of all of the tables and data sources available to you.

Use the filters at the top of the page to find the data you are interested in. Clicking on the name of one of a table or data source shows you detailed information about it. You won't be able to change these settings or edit the table unless it was shared with you with the **Edit** privilege. To see how to edit a data source, refer to the ThoughtSpot Administrator Guide.

From the **Data** screen, you can also delete or apply stickers to tables and data sources in bulk by selecting them and clicking the appropriate action button.

There are three types of data sources that you may see in the data list. They are tables, worksheets, and user uploaded data. You will most likely only see worksheets and user uploaded sources. These are the most commonly used data sources for searching.

-   **[Generate CSV files with the data to be loaded](../../../admin/loading/generate_flat_file.html)**  
The first step in loading data is to obtain or create one or more flat files that contain the data to be loaded into ThoughtSpot.
-   **[Load data from a web browser](../../../admin/loading/load_from_web_browserdita.html)**  
The simplest way to load data is to upload a CSV or Excel file from the ThoughtSpot Web interface. This method is recommended for small, one time data loads. Using this method, the data schema is created for you automatically.
-   **[Append data from a web browser](../../../admin/loading/append_data_from_a_web_browser.html)**  
 You can append data to your existing system tables through the ThoughtSpot application, even if the tables were initially loaded using Data Connect or tsload.
-   **[View your data profile](../../../admin/loading/view_your_data_profile.html)**  
Basic column data profile information is available under **Profile** on the Data page.
-   **[About sharing](../../../pages/end_user_guide/data_view/sharing_for_end_users.html)**  
Whenever you are working in ThoughtSpot, you are in your own private environment until you share your work with others. This applies to searches, pinboards, and any data you upload.
